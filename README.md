I am a dedicated Computer Science and Mathematics student at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, expected to graduate in May 2026. With a passion for technology and problem-solving, I've developed a strong foundation in both theoretical concepts and practical applications.

My academic journey has been complemented by practical experiences in software engineering, teaching, and leadership roles, allowing me to develop a well-rounded skill set that bridges technical expertise with effective communication and collaboration abilities.

I am particularly interested in leveraging technology to create innovative solutions to real-world problems, with experience spanning web development, game design, educational technology, and environmental applications.
